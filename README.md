# AirbnbRealEstateApp
CSE 6242 Data &amp; Visual Analytics Project

Airbnb has disrupted the hospitality market. Rooms rented on Airbnb are often cheaper and more desirable places to stay than hotels in many cities. New York City is no exception.

My team believed that savvy real estate investors in NYC could make a profit by buying properties for the sake of renting them out on Airbnb. Given data from Airbnb, Zillow, and NYC, we were able to create and deploy a web application that could help NYC real estate investors make purchasing decisions. The application shows the projected profitability in each neighborhood of NYC assuming that the buyer rented their new property on Airbnb. It also shows housing prices and aggregated statistics for each neighborhood.


## Setup
I used conda to manage environments. If you install conda, you can use the environment.yml file to create a virtual environment for this project that has all the packages that I used.
